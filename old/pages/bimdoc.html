  <h1 class="title">Bricks in Motion: Additional LEGO Photography <span class="year">(2015)</span></h1>
  <p class="desc">Philip Heinrich, director of <a href="http://movie.bricksinmotion.com/"><em>Bricks in Motion</em></a>, a documentary exploring the lives of individuals involved in the hobby of creating stop-motion animated films with LEGOÂ® bricks, asked me to create LEGO-built names for the key characters in the documentary. After designing and physically building these names, I aligned them with real-life footage to create the effect that the LEGO names were actually in the scene and photographed them.
